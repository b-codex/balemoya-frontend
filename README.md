## About The Project

BaleMoya is a multi-disciplinary platform that provides access to any professional at a moment's notice and also provides a platform where job applicants can look for job posts and employers/organizations/companies can post job memos. It eliminates the middleman by having a platform that connects you based on your area and the exact type of professional or work you are looking for. This platform provides either long term employment or a quick employment which can be looked at in two ways i.e. an urgent need for a professional like a doctor, plumber or repairman or a short-term employment that lasts for days or weeks at a time. It's frustrating when a simple technical problem happens or minor physical injury needs to be nursed but can't be addressed due to the lack of know-how.  We grant users and professionals a platform to easily get the information to contact each other. Our project intends to reduce the growing problem of unemployment as well as it creates the medium needed for the unemployed professionals to work as freelancers giving them more experience. Instead of using traditional methods of communication through brokers and word of mouth, we aim to try to eliminate the need for a third party by providing support using a platform where they can get the contact information easily and get in touch.
